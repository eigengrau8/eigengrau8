### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Harshita

Greetings and welcome to my GitHub profile!

Data fascinates me; The deeper I delve into this field, the more compelling it becomes. I am constantly exploring and learning new concepts, techniques and tools to uncover inights from data.
Within my GitHub repositories, you will find a blend of both theoretical exploration and practical application. Here, you will find a collection of projects ranging from simple data analysis exercies to more complex machine learning models.

Feel free to provide feedback on any of my projects. 
I am always open to connecting with fellow learners and like minded individuals.
Thank you for stopping by!
